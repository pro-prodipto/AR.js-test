## Description

The AR Custom Text project is an augmented reality (AR) application that displays custom text on top of a target image using AR technology. The custom text is extracted from the UTM parameter of the URL and rendered as a 3D text object when viewed through a compatible AR device or smartphone.

## Features

- Extract custom text from the UTM parameter of the URL.
- Render the custom text as a 3D object on top of a target image using AR technology.
- Support for multiple target images and custom text variations.
- Customize the appearance of the 3D text, such as font, color, size, and animation.
- Share the augmented reality experience with others by providing the URL with the UTM parameter.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ar-custom-text.git


## Usage
Launch the AR Custom Text application on your AR device or smartphone.
Open the URL with the UTM parameter containing the desired custom text (e.g., https://your-website.com?utm_customtext=Hello+World).
Point the AR device or smartphone camera towards the target image.
The custom text extracted from the UTM parameter will be rendered as a 3D object on top of the target image.
Share the URL with the UTM parameter to allow others to view the custom text in augmented reality.
